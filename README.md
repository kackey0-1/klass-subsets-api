# klass-subsets-api
Subsets REST Service

This API will serve to store, search and maintain KLASS subsets ("uttrekk").

**The application is under development.**

The goal is to replace the existing Node + Express implementation, which can be found at: https://github.com/statisticsnorway/klass-subsets-service
