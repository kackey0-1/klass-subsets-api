# klass-subsets-api
Subsets REST Service

This API will serve to store, search and maintain KLASS subsets ("uttrekk").

**The application is under development.**

The goal is to replace the existing Node + Express implementation, which can be found at: https://github.com/statisticsnorway/klass-subsets-service


# Testing against LDS locally

This application does not store any data locally. It uses LDS as its database.

To set up local instance of LDS against which you can test API calls, follow the steps in the README of this repository: https://github.com/statisticsnorway/klass-subsets-setup
